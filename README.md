# javafx_hibernate_demo
Simple demo application using JavaFX and Hiberation Framework. the Hibernation framework represents an object-relational mapper between the Java model classes and a RDBMS like mysql.

## project setup

This is an ecpilse project. To get it running, import it into Eclipse and adjust the build path to include your local copy of the hibernation framework. You can download it here: http://hibernate.org/orm/releases/5.3/. Further, you need the appropriate Java drivers for your database.
Next, add all jars from hibernate-release-5.3.1.Final/lib/required/.

Further, set up the database e.g. using the db_dump.sql script.

Good luck
